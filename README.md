# Google Search Clone 🔍
A simple multi-page website that mimics the core functionality and design of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
*This project was developed as part of the Harvard CS50 Web Programming course.*

## Features ✨

- **Google Search (index.html):**  
  - Centered search bar with rounded corners.  
  - “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky” buttons.  
  - Links to Image Search and Advanced Search pages.

- **Google Image Search (image.html):**  
  - Search bar for image queries.  
  - Link back to main Google Search page.

- **Google Advanced Search (advanced.html):**  
  - Four vertically stacked fields mimicking Google’s advanced search options:
    - All these words  
    - This exact word or phrase  
    - Any of these words  
    - None of these words  
  - Blue "Advanced Search" button.  
  - Link back to main Google Search page.


## Usage 🚀
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to start searching.  
2. Use the links in the top-right corner to navigate between pages.  
3. Perform searches that redirect to Google’s actual search results.


## Technologies 🛠️
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (including Flexbox for layout)


## Notes ⚠️
- This project redirects search queries to Google’s official pages; it does not implement search itself.  
- The “I’m Feeling Lucky” button redirects to the first Google search result.  
- Accessibility is considered via semantic HTML and labels.
